                  Planning to receive an invitation from the state of Tasmania
                  this year? Then you should know that the state’s 2025–26

                  Not only that, but the state has also confirmed that because
                  of the strong demand from skilled migrants, most of Tasmania’s
                  nomination places have already been filled. This means fewer
                  invitations are likely to be released in the coming weeks.

                For the 2025–26 program year, Tasmania received a total
                allocation of 1,850 nomination places, including:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-left text-[16px] text-[#042325]">
                <li>
                  <strong>1,200 places</strong> for the Skilled Nominated Visa

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>650 places</strong> for the Skilled Work Regional

              <p className="text-justify text-[16px] text-[#042325] leading-relaxed">
                As out of these numbers, the state has already issued most of
                this allocation, the focus is now shifting toward processing the
                applications that are currently in the system, rather than
                issuing a large number of new invitations. However, Tasmania
                confirmed that it will continue accepting Registrations of
                Interest (ROIs).

                Compared to the subclass 190 stream, the subclass 491 stream
                will continue to invite skilled workers across all pass

                also confirmed that the number of invitations issued will be
                reduced compared to earlier rounds. This trend can already be
                seen in the recent Tasmania invitation round result released on
