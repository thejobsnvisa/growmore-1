              (SBS) is a crucial part of the employer-sponsored visa process in
              Australia, enabling an Australian business to sponsor an overseas
              worker for either a temporary or a permanent visa.

            <p className="text-[#727272] mt-6 leading-relaxed text-justify  text-sm sm:text-base">
              To be eligible for Standard Business Sponsorship, an employer must
              have a good record of compliance with both Australian immigration
              and workplace laws, as well as being a financially stable
              business.

                The Standard Business Sponsorship approval is valid for five
                years and can be renewed if the employer wishes to continue
                sponsoring workers. During this period, the employer is
                obligated to fulfill certain responsibilities, such as reporting
                to the Department of Home Affairs regarding the visa holder’s
                employment and ensuring they receive appropriate wages and
                working conditions.

                It is important for businesses to consider the benefits and
                obligations of becoming a Standard Business Sponsor before
                making the decision to sponsor a worker. This includes the
                positive impact it can have on their workforce and the ability
                to access a global pool of skilled workers, as well as the legal
                responsibilities and ongoing reporting requirements.
