                  So, if you have an average profile and are expecting an

                In this round, mainly invitations were issued for Subclass 190
                (Skilled Nominated Visa), and only limited movement was seen in
                the Subclass 491 (Regional Visa) category.

                Not just that, but the majority of invitations are issued for
                onshore applicants, which shows Victoria’s ongoing preference
                for candidates who are already contributing to the local
                workforce.

                Key Observations from This Round

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-left text-[16px] text-[#042325]">
                <li>
                  High number of invitations were issued between 90 to 105
                  points, which indicates that any profile below 90 points has a
                  very low chance of receiving an invitation unless you have
                  something exceptional.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Several high-demand roles, including Engineering Professionals
                  (NEC), Software Engineers, and Taxation Accountants, peaked at
                  105 points in the latest Victoria nomination round.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Many successful applicants had skilled partners, showing that
                  a partner’s point can help you receive an invitation. Apart
                  from this, salary, English level, and NAATI credentials also
                  contribute to receiving an invitation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A small number of applicants also get an invitation as
                  offshore but mostly reserved for highly experienced
                  candidates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This round mainly targeted industries like IT & Tech,
                  Engineering, Business & Finance, Marketing & Creative, and
                  Education, which shows in which sector Victoria currently
                  needs workforce.
